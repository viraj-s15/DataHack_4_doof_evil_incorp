### Prerequisites <a name = "prerequisites"></a>

Before cloning the project, I highly recommend using a virtual environment, since the scale of this project was not very large, I have used `pip`.
If this project has a larger scale or is to be worked on by others, I would recommned `conda` instead.

First, create a python env and install all the dependencies
```bash
python3 -m venv venv
# activate env
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
